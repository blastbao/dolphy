Charlie and Lola out, Alice up

Charlie and Lola starts on CBeebies tomorrow, November 7th, playing at 6pm every week night with double doses on weekends at 1.30pm and 4.30pm. There's been a lot of promotional coverage on the BBC's terrestrial TV and radio channels in the last fortnight; it's very exciting to hear our tune coming over the, like, public airwaves. For archivists: this is a rough early version of the theme tune, one of three that Soren and I presented to Tiger Aspect when we pitched for the job. It was hastily labelled the 'Lido' theme, because we finished the main melody after spending an afternoon at Chipping Norton's lido (strapline: "More than just a heated swimming pool").

Alice learned to stand up on her own this week. She pushes herself up from a crouch, arms out like a surfer, and looks around happily for congratulations. A few seconds later she falls heavily on her fat little bottom and starts again. Here's a nine second clip from my mobile.
