Never Eat a Tomato

Soren drove up from London and we spent the evening working on a soundtrack for a proposed animation of one of Lauren's Charlie and Lola books.

The result (click here for a 20 second snippet) is rather melancholy for children's TV, but I like it. 

I'm also very pleased with my new, minaturised studio, which sound technology obsessives will have already identified as the OS X version of Logic Platinum on a G4 PowerBook and the MOTU 828 firewire audio interface. All the sounds on this track come from the EXS 24 virtual sampler, apart from Soren's guitar and Maisie's voice. If you play a fine trumpet and live in Oxfordshire, you could come and record the horn section for us.
